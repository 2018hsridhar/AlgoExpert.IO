Famous single-source, all targets, shortest-path algorithms for a positively weighted directed graph
- Cycle handling ( may OR may not handle cycles ) 
- Fails @ negative edge weights
- Note the case where no path is found as well ( output = -1 ) 
- no self-loops

Sample Input
start = 0				# 0-indexed vertex
edges = [
  [[1, 7]],
  [[2, 6], [3, 20], [4, 3]],
  [[3, 14]],
  [[4, 2]],

Vertex starts in range 0,1,2,3,4,5

Sample Output
[0, 7, 13, 27, 10, -1]

|V| = len(edges)

You're given an integer start and a list edges of pairs of integers.

The list is what's called an adjacency list, and it represents a graph. 
The number of vertices in the graph is equal to the length of edges, where 
each index i in edges contains vertex i's outbound edges, in no particular order.
Each individual edge is represented by an pair of two numbers, [destination, distance], 
where the destination is a positive integer denoting the destination vertex and the distance 
is a positive integer representing the length of the edge (the distance from vertex i to vertex
destination). Note that these edges are directed, meaning that you can only travel from a 
particular vertex to its destinationâ€”not the other way around (unless the destination vertex 
itself has an outbound edge to the original vertex).

Write a function that computes the lengths of the shortest paths between start and all of 
the other vertices in the graph using Dijkstra's algorithm and returns them in an array. 
Each index i in the output array should represent the length of the shortest path between
start and vertex i. If no path is found from start to vertex i, then output[i] should be -1.

Note that the graph represented by edges won't contain any self-loops (vertices that have 
an outbound edge to themselves) and will only have positively weighted edges (i.e., no negative
distances).

If you're unfamiliar with Dijkstra's algorithm, we recommend watching the Conceptual Overview 
section of this question's video explanation before starting to code.
