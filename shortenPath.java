/*
Function takes in a non-empty string representing a valid UNIX-shell path
Return the SHORTERED/ABRIDGED version of said path
Paths may be absolute paths or relative paths 

/ := the directory seperator
.. := the parent directory
. := the current directory
Once at root directory, future parent directory accesses perform no operation as well
/ ../../..

> Common pattern : long->short path, and both point to the same shared element
Abriged path and long path must point to the same file

COMPLEXITY
Let N := length of path
Let D := the depth of thy path

Space =
