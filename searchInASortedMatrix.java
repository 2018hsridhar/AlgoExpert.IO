Brute Force Solution : 
Let M := number of rows in the matrix
Let N := number of cols in the matrix

Evaluate each element and perform element-by-element comparison
if target value is in the matrix OR not
If in matrix, return that pair
Otherwise, return {-1,-1}

Complexity : 
RunTime = O(MN) [Polynomial - Quadratic ]
Space = O(1)

Denoting a column matrix as if it were typed as a row matrix, via {} closing brackets
Edge Case Testing : 
(A) [1] target = 1, target = 0
(B) [1,3,6,8,9]  targets = {-1,1,3,5,9,10} : search within bounds is a good way!
(C) {}
(D) [2,3
		6,7]		Square Matrix
(E) [2,3,6
		6,7,10]		Rectangular Matrix
(F)
(G)
