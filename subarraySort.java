Maybe O(N) storage of the encountered (min,max) also needed as well?
Dynamic data structures to incorporate

 0	1		2		3		4		5		6		7		8		9		10	11	12
[1,	2,	4,	7,	10,	11,	7,	12,	6,	7,	16,	18,	19]
 -----------------------^ 
 ---------  <=======================>  ----------

Strategies : Nested Intervals, Recursion, DP, Two Pointers ( left,right meet-in-the-middle ) 
Can also grab the global minima and the global maxima
Can also consider the sliding window technique as well

Subarray to sort : NOT to reverse
